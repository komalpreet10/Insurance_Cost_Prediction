# Insurance_Cost_Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting health insurance premiums** using **machine learning and data visualization**.  
Insurance companies traditionally rely on broad actuarial tables and averages, which often fail to capture individual health differences.  
By leveraging **data-driven approaches**, this project aims to deliver more **personalized, fair, and accurate premium predictions**.

### Why this project matters:
- 💡 **Enhance Precision in Pricing** → Premiums reflect actual individual risk.  
- 🏆 **Increase Competitiveness** → More attractive and sustainable pricing.  
- 😀 **Improve Customer Satisfaction** → Fair and transparent premium calculations.  
- 📊 **Risk Assessment & Policy Development** → Identify key factors influencing costs and guide product design.  
- 🔮 **Strategic Insights** → Support insurers in decision-making and market expansion.  
- 🌐 **Deployment** → A web-based calculator allows real-time premium estimation for customers and agents.

✨ This project demonstrates the complete **data science pipeline**:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Machine Learning Modeling  
- Interactive Tableau Dashboards  
- Deployment via **Flask/Streamlit** for end-user accessibility
